		<p>Legendary Australian <b>wicket-keeper batsman Adam Gilchrist</b> has named India great Mahendra Singh Dhoni among the three greatest wicket-keeper batsmen</p>
		<p> However, Gilchrist mentioned one other name before he got to Dhoni. Gilchrist, who is one of cricket's greatest wicket-keeper batsmen himself, chose the name of fellow Australia great Rodney Marsh before MS Dhoni. Terming Marsh his idol, Gilchrist stated that he was his role model. The 2003 and 2007 World Cup winner appreciated Dhoni's calmness and composure, and rounded off his Top 3 with Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara.</p>
		<p>"Rodney Marsh, he was my idol. That's who I wanted to be. MS Dhoni, I like his coolness. He did it in his way, always calm. And Kumar Sangakkara. He was so classy in everything he did, batting high up the order and with his keeping skills," said Gilchrist, speaking to The Times of India.</p>
